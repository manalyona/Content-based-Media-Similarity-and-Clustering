# Content-based_Media_Similarity_and_Clustering

Code for the comparison of three algorithms for media clustering, based on a) word frequencies, b) most cited people, and c) simple topic modeling. They were tested on the dataset of 38 Russian-landuage media outlets. 

Notes:
1. Raw data contain copyrighted texts and were not published. Files with preprocessed data were added to 'Algorithms' folder.
2. Parsers for most media are given for 2020, articles for (at least) 2019 can be parsed by analogy. 
3. Parsing takes from several minutes to hours depending on the media outlet. Topic modeling requires quite a lot of memory.
